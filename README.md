# ü§ñ Linear Multivariable Control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)

> Design and simulation of an **LQR-based optimal control system** for the vertical plane motion of an **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)**, improving stability and precision over traditional PID control.

## üåä Overview

This project was completed as part of the *Linear Multivariable Control* course  
in the **Erasmus Mundus MIR Programme** at Universit√© de Toulon.  

The goal was to design an **optimal control law (LQR)** to regulate an AUV‚Äôs vertical motion ‚Äî  
maintaining depth and pitch stability under hydrodynamic disturbances.  

A MATLAB-based control model was developed to:
- Identify **hydrodynamic parameters** through data fitting,
- Linearize the nonlinear vehicle model around equilibrium,
- Implement and tune an **LQR controller**, and
- Validate its performance through simulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Parameter Identification** | Estimated missing hydrodynamic parameters (e.g., damping coefficients) using least squares (`lsqr`) and constrained optimization (`fmincon`) from recorded mission data. |
| **2. Linearization** | Derived equilibrium points and computed linear state-space matrices **A** and **B** for the vertical plane. |
| **3. LQR Control Design** | Designed an optimal **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)** controller minimizing the cost function `J = ‚à´(x·µÄQx + u·µÄRu)dt`. |
| **4. Tuning Q & R** | Tuned Q and R matrices to balance state tracking accuracy and control effort. |
| **5. Simulation & Validation** | Tested depth and pitch control in MATLAB/Simulink to assess steady-state error, overshoot, and response time. |

## üß† Key Results

| Metric | Achieved Value | Requirement |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Depth overshoot | **1.4 m** | < 2 m |
| Steady-state error | **‚âà 0** | ‚âà 0 |
| Pitch oscillation | **Low / Stable** | Minimal |
| Response time | **‚âà 125 s to 10 m depth** | Acceptable |

## üìä Control Insight

- The **LQR controller** achieved precise and smooth depth control with minimal oscillations.  
- **Pitch angle** and **angular velocity** converged steadily to zero after reaching target depth.  
- **Actuator commands** (rear helms & motor RPM) remained stable, ensuring low energy consumption.  
- The approach significantly outperformed traditional PID control in stability and efficiency.
